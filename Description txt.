Here is my visual argument preview 
As of right now it feature a man who chased money and is no longer living the life he thought he wanted.
Under the images in the text it say "Don't chase money, chase happiness"
I feel that this is important in todays society to not get caught up in living a life we don't want to live but rather choose a life that we do. 

This is just a start so I have to add a whole different section for happinesss and add color and shading.
